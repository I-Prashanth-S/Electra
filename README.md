# Electra - Automation System for Electricity Management

Electra is an arduino based automation system that develops a framework for interconnecting the electronic appliances in a room, that can detect the presence of an individual in the functional range of a device using a computer vision algorithm and accordingly switch it on and off. This in turn helps in saving a huge proportion of electricity consumption, and takes away the hassle of switching the devices on and off, from the user.
